# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
What I learned:
SocketIO is similar to AJAX except it is built with the intention to replace AJAX.
AJAX is an older protocol, which consumes alot of resources (from alot of browser add ons), whereas SocketIO performs on
WebSocket protocol which is better since more data can be sent at less resource cost.
However, it does not mean Ajax is useless, as popular opinion believes on REST dev AJAX API works well.
They aren't mutually exclusive. Use whatever is suitable for the scope, and scale of the project.
